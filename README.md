ListNode.java: my solution to leetcode's problem from March 1st-7th(https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/march-leetcoding-challenge-2021/588/week-1-march-1st-march-7th/3660/).  Solution includes both the "brute force" way of finding the intersection and the faster hashmap solution.


Also included here are a few solutions to some hackerrank problems I solved(both can still be optimized of course!).  

LeftRotation.java: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/array-left-rotation/problem
